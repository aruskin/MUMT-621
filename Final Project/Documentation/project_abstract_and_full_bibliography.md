# Abstract

We explore the task of musical artist recommendation using live event data. Music festivals and concerts with shared bills provide attendees with the opportunity to discover new artists, and much of that information is available from crowdsourced databases of event data. By aggregating event data and finding sets of artists who have performed at the same venues, we can provide an alternative method of artist discovery to recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems are often prone to the cold-start problem, which makes it difficult to generate recommendations for new users with no rating history or recommending items that have not been rated by enough users; since our approach does not rely on user preference data, we can avoid these issues. We present a prototype recommendation system that allows a user to input a query artist and receive a list of the artists with the most shared venues, based on event data from Setlist.fm and MusicBrainz, as well as a comparison of the two databases and their metadata schemas.
