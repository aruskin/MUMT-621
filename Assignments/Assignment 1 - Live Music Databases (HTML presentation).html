<h1>Live Music Databases</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Value of concert recordings</h2>
<h3>Music research</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corpus for music information retrieval tasks like genre detection, key detection, cover detection, etc. (Bechhofer et al. 2013)</li>
<li>Multiple recordings of same songs by same artists allow for comparison across performances (Bechhofer et al. 2013)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Archival perspective</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evidentiary value of material outside of a band's "official" releases</li>
<li>Different recordings of the same event can add to the collective memory by capturing multiple perspectives</li>
<li>By allowing members of the community to download and duplicate materials, online archives ensure the preservation of their materials in a way that would not be possible for traditional archives with more limitations on access (Wallace 2009)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>History of tape-trading</h2>
<h3>Grateful Dead community</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fans taping and trading tapes of Grateful Dead concerts since the 1960s (Jones 2005)
<ul>
	<li>Taping officially permitted by band and encouraged by special tapers’ section at concerts</li>
	<li>Fans must follow rules for noncommercial use of tapes</li>
	<li>Tapes traded in person and through postal system (Wallace 2009)</li>
</ul>
	<li>Grateful Dead tape-trading community was early adopter of networked computing and most active discussion group on the Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link (WELL), a virtual community created in the mid-1980s (Jones 2005)
<ul>
	<li>Networked computing made it easier for fans to seek out information on tapes and for traders to distribute their tapes</li>
	<li>pre-WELL: competitive trader hierarchies, post-WELL: tapes more accessible to everyone via online trading fora (Wallace 2009)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Grateful Dead tape-trading community’s adoption of networked computing served as a model for later bands (e.g. Phish) to build online communities (Jones 2005)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Metadata standards</h3>
<ul>
	<li>As tape-trading networks expanded, participants developed standards of practice with regard to documentation</li>
	<ul><li>Traders’ holding lists would generally include the date, location, venue, and a sound quality grade of the taped shows</li>
	<li>Tapers’ descriptions would include recording steps and technical specifications (Wallace 2009; Jones 2005)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Crowdsourced efforts to compile concert and setlist data</li>
	<ul><li>DeadBase started in 1987 as one fan’s computer science masters program project and eventually became a collaborative effort between fans, with official approval and assistance from the band, to accurately document and publish the Grateful Dead’s complete concert date, venue, and setlist data (Wallace 2009)</li>
	<li>Description related to any given performance may be continually improved or enriched by the community (Wallace 2009)</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Projects using LMA data</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://etree.linkedmusic.org/about/" target="_blank">Live Music Archive Linked Data</a> (Bechhofer et al. 2013)
<ul>
	<li><b>Motivation:</b> Research activities would benefit from structured metadata for recordings in LMA, but existing LMA metadata inconsistent in detail and content</li>
	<li>Layered approach to create RDF-structured metadata for recordings
<ul>
	<li>Core metadata published “as is,” with raw LMA data translated to RDF with vocabulary terms from existing ontologies</li>
	<li>Additional information added from mapping to other collections (e.g. MusicBrainz, last.fm, GeoNames)</li>
	<li><a href="http://etree.linkedmusic.org/page/artist/4231b110-4aac-012f-19e9-00254bd44c28" target="_blank">Example RDF record for Grateful Dead</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Created web application to allow query and browsing of collection with SPARQL</li>

	<li>Extension of LMA Linked Data project</li>
	<li>Extracting audio features from LMA recordings and using to perform tasks such as:
